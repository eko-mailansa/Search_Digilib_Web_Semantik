                <br/>The Semantic Web is an extension of the Web through standards by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
                The standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource Description Framework (RDF).
                
                <br/><br/>The concept of the Semantic Network Model was formed in the early 1960s by the cognitive scientist Allan M. Collins, linguist M. Ross Quillian and psychologist Elizabeth F. Loftus as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge.
                When applied in the context of the modern internet, it extends the network of hyperlinked human-readable web pages by inserting machine-readable metadata about pages and how they are related to each other. 
                This enables automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform more tasks on behalf of users. 
                The term "Semantic Web" was coined by Tim Berners-Lee,[3] the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C"), which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. 
                He defines the Semantic Web as "a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines".
